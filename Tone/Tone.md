## Error messages
Use "please" rarely. This snippet from Microsoft's Windows 7 guidelines makes sense:
> Avoid the word "please," except in situations in which the user is asked to do something inconvenient (such as waiting) or the software is to blame for the situation.
Correct: Please wait while Windows copies the files to your computer.
