# Px, Ems, Rems, and Percentages
* Px should be used when creating design specifications and redlines.
* Ems and rems should be used in the code, over px, whenever possible. 
    * Ems and rems can be used at the developers discretion. 

# Padding and Margin
* When designers are designing, they should keep in mind how developers measure spacing. Designers should try to describe measurements in terms of margin and padding when creating specifications.
