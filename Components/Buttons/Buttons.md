**Hover**
* These buttons will lift off the page and form a shadow when the user hovers over the buttons with their cursor. This will reiterate the button’s presence and will draw the user’s eye towards the buttons.

**Active**

* Buttons are active when they have been clicked on. This allows users to understand if an action has already been completed. In this state, no additional actions should occur if buttons are clicked on repeatedly.

**Disabled**

* These are buttons that cannot be clicked on and are not accessible. For example, these buttons would be used when a form or input has not been completed properly and the user cannot proceed without corrections.

**Disabled State with Pop-up**
* When a disabled button is clicked, a red pop-up should appear that explains to the user why the clicking the disabled button is not allowing them to proceed.
* This is also helpful for those with visual imparements, as screen readers can read the text in the pop-up and describe what is wrong to the user.
