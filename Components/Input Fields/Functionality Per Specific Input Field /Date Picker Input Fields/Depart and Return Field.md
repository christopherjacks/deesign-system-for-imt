# Depart/Return
* Past dates are grayed out
* There are two fields, one for departure dates and one for return dates
    * On focus, the date field calendar appears
    
## The Basics
* On focus, on mobile, the calendar appears in the users viewport, either below or above the input field
* On desktop or tablets the calendar appears just within the userâ€™s view on screen
* Date picker allows you to jump by month and year
* A user can manually enter a date on desktop computers and mobile
    * If a user does not manually enter slashes, the form autofills the slashes
    * If a user does enter slashes, the form remains as is
    * A user is able to enter a two digit or four digit year

## Validations/Error Messages
